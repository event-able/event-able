# event-able

Making events more accessible.

## Developing

Run `make build` to generate the static HTML, then `make serve` to start a local development server.

Add static files to the `static/` folder, and refer to them in `/static/` on the site. For HTML add to the `templates/` folder which uses Jinja2 syntax.
